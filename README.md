# What is it?

This folder contains Eurorack modules (PCBs and panels) that I designed. They are all open to use, but you must make any derivatives open too. If you use them commercially, please donate 10% of profits to a charity nearby you.

I will add detailed part lists and assembly instructions if and when I make them.

# Circuits

* calculate: uses a few op-amps to perform basic operations like attenuversion, addition, and comparison.
	* Parts: thonk jacks, thonk 50k pots, {1k, 10k, 100k} resistors, tl074 op-amps, 3mm LEDs, 10-pin power.

* rasa6: a generic 1-input, 2-parameter, 2-output Arduino Beetle Eurorack module shield with optional DAC support.
	* Parts: thonk jacks, thonk 50k pots, {150k, 220k} resistors, mcp4822 (optional), 16-pin power.

* switched-mult: a 9-jack mult that can route a 3-jack mult to one of two different sets of 3-jack mults.
	* Parts: thonk jacks, thonk sub-mini switch.
